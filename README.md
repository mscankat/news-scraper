# news-scraper
This is a news scraper that i wrote for my [news-app](https://github.com/mscankat/news-app) repo.

This script listens specific RSS feeds. If it detects a new news, it scrapes the news from its website. Then it pushes the data to my database using an endpoint of an API that I created [here](https://github.com/mscankat/news-api)
